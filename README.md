# _Full Stack Web Developer Project / Arashi Walker_

#### _iCivics Tic Tac Toe, 11/12/2020_

#### By _Arashi Walker_

## Overview

* Please provide a sample program.  This exercise is to develop a simple tic-tac-toe game.
There are 2 players, player 1 (X) and player 2 (O) who place their marks on a 3x3 grid.  
Player 1 and player 2 alternate moves until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
The program should:
	Take input from each player for alternating moves
	If one player marks 3 squares across, down, or diagonally they are declared the winner
	If all 9 squares are marked and no one has won, the game ends in a draw.
You can submit your program in any language you choose, be it Java, Javascript, Php, Python, or another language.  Include a simple explanation of your strategy.
